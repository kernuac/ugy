# UGY

This is an old project that I created long time ago, when I was an
Student. The goal was walk through a castle solving some puzzles
related with the basic arithmetic operations. The code base is a really
mess but it was my first approach to game develop...

The game was written in Python 2 using pygame libaries.

Maybe, I'll continue this project with a more maintainable code base
, using Python 3 and a better goal for the game.
